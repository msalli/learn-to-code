### Git: 
[Tutorial by GitHub](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) Note: Learning Git from GitHub might make it hard to grasp that these two things are not the same. [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/) also offers a tutorial that I found helpful.

### JavaScript:
[What's the best way to learn JavaScript](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-learn-JavaScript)? Quora has already answered this for us.

### Trusted Resources: 
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): Looks janky, but it's legit. When you're Googling answers to all your coding obstacles, StackOverflow answers are usually at the top of the list. 

[Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/): W3Schools will come up first in Google searches, because they somehow have SEO juice that won't quit. MDN is a better resource.
